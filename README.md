# Final_Project

## Description
This code simulates a point projectile moving in a fixed, spherical potential.

## Instructions for Installation
This program runs in Jupyter notebook. In order to get the software, please follow the instructions on their website, http://jupyter.org/.

Specifically, this program uses Anaconda3. Once installed, this notebook may be forked for personal use. Programs from the individual files can be imported into other projects, or space in the sheets themselves may be used to run the calculations.

## Other Required Codes
All imports are part of the standard Jupyter installation, and have been included as an import block at the top of the notebook. Note, it imports the packages with prefixes (such as importing the numpy library as "np").

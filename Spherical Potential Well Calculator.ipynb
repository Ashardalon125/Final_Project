    "In quantum physics, particles are often contained in regions known as potential wells. These are areas where the energy of a particle contained within is converting part of its total energy to potential energy, leaving it with the remaining amount as a kinetic energy. Often times, a potential well is categorized by infinite walls around the focal area, preventing the particle from existing for a long time outside the walls before being forced back in or dying off completely.\n",

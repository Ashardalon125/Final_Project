## Seven Steps to Writing Good Code
Cited from http://www.davidketcheson.info/2015/05/10/rock_solid_code.html for personal reference

1) Use version control
2) Put your code in the cloud, in the open
3) Add a README and a license
4) Write docstrings
5) Write tests
6) Keep track of issues
7) Automate the tests

## Thoughts
Potential wells are often used to define the behaviour of particles on the quantum level. At the quantum level, the potential well yields information about the probabilities of finding a particle in a given region. Describing the behaviour of a particle in a well defined potential well can show behaviour of several tied physics concepts.

## General Outline
### 1) General Area
This project will deal with a quantum potential well and a point particle moving through it. This will show several key behaviours according when it comes to the boundary conditions and assumptions.
